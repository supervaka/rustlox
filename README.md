# rustlox

The thousandth rust implementation of lox.
Based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

This was a learning project to get hands-on with Rust. Lots of clone() was used where it probably wasn't necessary.
I didn't want to diverge too far from the java code, so there are some design choices that might feel tortured for rust.
